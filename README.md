# PONG-GAME
My first game! I learned a lot doing this project. Still lots to add to make it more exciting!
I learned a lot about import/export, how modules work and how to tackle CORS errors >:(
I also learned a lot about getters and setters
Main thing that took me the longest was figuring out how to update the ball in a natural way. Had to use cos/sin to obtain a new angle for the balls
direction every reset of the game
I need to add a start and game over screen but I'm not quite there yet
